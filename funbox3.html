<h1>Vulnhub Funbox:Easy </h1>
<p>Today's box is the Funbox: Easy Box from Vulnhub. This box can be found at this link:  <a href="https://www.vulnhub.com/entry/funbox-easy,526/">Funbox:Easy box</a> </p>

<h2 id="initial-enumeration-">Initial enumeration:</h2>
<p>With this box we start with nmap: </p>
<p>
  <code><i>sudo nmap -T4 -p- the ip of the funbox vm</i></code>
</p>
<p>We have 80 and 22, possibly 33060 <br>Quick overview: <br>
  <code><i>Port 80 is HTTP</i></code>
  <br>
  <code><i>Port 22 is SSH</i></code>
  <br>
  <code><i>Port 33060 is MySQL</i></code> from the port 3306 (they just happened to add an extra 0)
</p>
<p>If we dirb it we find a gym page, a secret page and an admin login page. <br>To dirb a page write: <br>
  <code><i>dirb http://ip of the vm box here</i></code>
</p>
<p>Some more time later using dirb we fnd a store page which is a bookstore. </p>
<p>The admin, secret and gym pages do nothing useful. </p>
<p>What you want is the store page. </p>
<p>In the store page there is an admin log in at the bottom of the page. Navigate to the store admin page and use the creds admin:admin <br>(Default creds are usually admin admin or admin password) </p>
<p>After logging as admin, we can now upload new books, complete with image upload facilities. <br>Time to upload a reverse shell, access it and catch it as per usual. </p>
<p>For context: <br>We catch a reverse shell with netcat after uploading it to the new book page we got as admin. <br>Since the shell will be uploaded using the image upload feature, it will be stored in the image folder. Click on it, have your netcat ready and you should get a connection. </p>
<h2 id="user-shell-">User shell:</h2>
<p>You should now have shell as www-data. </p>
<p>Looking around the system there is a file called password.txt </p>
<p>In this file you find creds for a user called Tony among creds for other services such as the before mentioned bookstore admin page. <br>Copy these creds over and login with SSH. We will login with SSH as the user Tony. </p>
<h2 id="root-shell-">Root shell:</h2>
<p>Once logged in as Tony check your sudo privs by running <i>sudo -l</i> </p>
<p>It appears that Tony can run a lot of applications as root using the sudo rights. There are many privilige escalation opportunities since there are many binaries the Tony user can run. </p>
<p>Some priv esc examples for this users are: pkexec and time </p>
<p>To gain root using the time binary: simply write <code><i>sudo time /bin/bash</i></code>
  <br>Alternatively to use pkexec: simply write <code><i>sudo pkexec /bin/bash</i></code>
</p>
