 Tryhackme has just come out with their <em>easiest path yet</em>
</h4>
<p>
 It is called the Pre security path. And it is even more simple than the
 Complete Beginner path
</p>
<p>So simple, even my mom can do it.</p>
<p>
 First we have a bit of networking

</p>
<p>Easy stuff. Trust me, I&#39;m a cat.</p>
<p>
 Web stuff

</p>
<p>
 Basic Linux stuff: If you&#39;re gonna be a super hacker cat (or dog, or
 whatever your favourite pet is) you need your Linux.

<p>Everyone knows Windows but does everyone <em>know</em> Windows?</p>

<p>Well now you do.</p>
<p>
 Now that we have that settled go join Tryhackme if you havent already and do
 the path! The subscription is also super cheap, only $10 (about 8.44 euro or
 7.22 UK pounds)
